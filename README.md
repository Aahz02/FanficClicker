### Description:
A clicker game about writing, uploading, and earning kudos from fanfiction stories.
The player can then spend these kudos to buy upgrades that improve their fanfics
and earn more kudos. One type of these upgrades is tags, categories that the fanfics
the player produces fall into which can be toggled on and off. By selecting tags that
go together the player will earn more kudos. Periodically an event will occur that
will call for fanfics with certain themes, the player can submit a fanfic to this
event and choose from the tags they have unlocked to produce a fanfic that fits the
theme and earn a ton of kudos based on how well their fanfic fit the theme.
